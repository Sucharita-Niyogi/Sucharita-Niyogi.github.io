I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Graduate School of Science at Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan. I work under Prof. Takeshi Kawasaki from the Non-equilibrium physics group. My current work mainly focuses on the jamming mechanism of granular systems and their mechanism under frictional force. I did my Ph.D. under Dr. Bhaskar Sen Gupta, Associate Professor from Vellore Institute of Technology, India.  My Ph.D. work was mainly focused on exploring the mechanical characteristics of amorphous glassy systems, specifically emphasizing porous glasses. I employ theoretical and numerical methods, specifically Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, under the athermal quasi-static (AQS) protocol to understand the characteristics of these porous glassy systems. Numerical simulations were conducted using the LAMMPS simulator package, and the analysis of pore topography was performed with Zeo++ software. Additionally, mechanical property analyses were carried out using C and FORTRAN programming.
